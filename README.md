# Hephaestus

An attempt to write an actual game in C++23. 

I will be using OpenGL 4.6. Perhaps when I found a form or state I am happy with I might make it flexible enough
to handle Vulkan too, let's see. Also trying to not turn this into a complete spaghetti monster, 
by separating some concerns, perhaps.

Various people help or have helped me in the process. Be it funny comments, harsh critiques, 
actual advise or ideas for the future.

Thank you in alphabetical order :)
